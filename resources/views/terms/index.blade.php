    <p>3.2 –&nbsp;<strong>If we cannot accept your order.</strong>&nbsp;If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the product. This might be because the product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product or because we are unable to meet any intended delivery deadline you have specified.</p>

    <p>3.3 –&nbsp;<strong>Your order number.</strong>&nbsp;We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.</p>

    </p>

    <p>4. – OUR PRODUCTS</p>

    <p>4.1 – Products may vary slightly from their pictures. Our products are personalised to your specifications using either your design ideas or ours. The images of the products on our website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that a device’s display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the products. Your product may vary slightly from those images. Our range of design ideas may vary from time to time and we accept no liability should at any time one of these images be no longer available for your use.</p>

    <p>4.2 –&nbsp;<strong>Making sure any material you supply to us for the purposes of the personalisation of the product is accurate and correct.</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for ensuring that any material, be it images or text, supplied to us is accurate and correct.

If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the product, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change. If we cannot make the change requested you will not have the right to cancel the order because the product will be deemed bespoke as it will have been designed to your specifications (see clause 8.3).

    <p>7.3 –&nbsp;<strong>We are not responsible for delays outside our control.</strong>&nbsp;If our supply of the products is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay.

    <p>7.8 –&nbsp;<strong>What will happen if you do not give required information to us.</strong>&nbsp;If you have not provided us with all the information required to personalise the product as detailed on the website we may contact you to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (and clause 10.2 will apply) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p>

    <p>7.9 –&nbsp;<strong>Reasons we may suspend the supply of products to you.</strong>&nbsp;We may have to suspend the supply of a product to:<br>
    (a) – deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes; or<br>
    (b) – update the product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</p>

    <p>7.10 –&nbsp;<strong>Your rights if we suspend the supply of products.</strong>&nbsp;We will contact you in advance to tell you if we will be suspending supply of the product, unless the problem is urgent or an emergency.

    </p>

    <p>8. – YOUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT; YOUR RIGHTS TO A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT</p>

    <p>8.1 –&nbsp;<strong>You can end your contract with us.</strong>&nbsp;If the product you have received is faulty or mis-described you may have a legal right to end the contract or to get the product repaired or replaced or a service re-performed or to get some or all of your money back, (see clause 11);<br>
    However, if you have just changed your mind about the product you will not have the right to end the contract if the product is personalised because the consumer cancellation rights will not apply to such products purchased from our website (see clause 8.3 for further details).</p>

    <p>8.2 –&nbsp;<strong>Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do.</strong></p>

    <p>If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (d) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:</p>

    <p>(a) – we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;<br>
    (b) – there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control (see clause 7.3);<br>
    (c) – we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons (see clause 7.10)<br>
    (d) – you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p>

    <p>8.3 –&nbsp;<strong>Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013).</strong>&nbsp;For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund. However, these rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, exclude all products that are made to the consumer’s specifications or are personalised and the right to cancel shall therefore not apply to any personalised products purchased from our website.</p>

    <p>8.4 –&nbsp;<strong>How long do I have to change my mind?</strong></p>

    <p>For standard, non-personalised products you have 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the goods.</p>

    <p>8.5 –&nbsp;<strong>Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind.</strong>&nbsp;Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 8.1), you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for goods is completed when the product is delivered. If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have not changed your mind, just contact us to let us know. The contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract including costs connected with the cost of the product and its personalisation if personalisation has taken place.
